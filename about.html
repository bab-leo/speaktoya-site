      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Founded in 2008 as <strong>Speak to the Youth</strong>, our organization began with a simple but powerful vision: to create safe spaces where young people could find guidance, mentorship, and encouragement. Over the years, we recognized that many adults in our community were also in need of the same resources and support systems.</p>
      <p>In response, we expanded our mission and our name to become <strong>Speak to the Youth & Adults</strong>â€”a reflection of our commitment to serving people of all ages. Today, we empower both youth and adults by providing mentorship, community connections, life-skills development, and opportunities for creative expression.</p>
      <p>We believe that every individual deserves to be heard, supported, and given the tools to thrive. Our programs are designed to build confidence, inspire growth, and strengthen families and communities.</p>
